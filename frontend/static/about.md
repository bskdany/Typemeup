# Why Typemeup?
There is a hole in the market for a typing website that has a minimalistic design, can alghoritimically improve your typing speed and has a realtime competition mode.

Typemeup is here to fill that hole, while providing most features of the main ones like Monkeytype, Keybr and 10fastfingers.

It's definetely not easy, there is a lot of work to be done, but development is fast and we are getting there.

## Smart mode
The smart mode analyses your key presses and generates a custom typing test with words that you'll most likely need to improve. It does so by creating a score for each key based on it's wpm, accuracy and the number of times you've pressed the key.

## Smart text correction
This feature allows you to have a more accurate wpm and accuracy calculation by analizying the errors you make live.

|           |target text | user typing text | accuracy%|
|-----------|------------------|------------|-----------|
|standard correction  | hello | hllo | 25% |
|smart corection      | hello | hllo | 75% |

How? The standard correction sees the last 3 chars as incorrect, while the smart correction sees the last 3 chars as correct and a missing e between the l and o.
Give it a try and see the difference!

## Design
Typemeup is designed to be as minimalistic as possible, while giving space for customizations. An incoming theme marketplace is work in progress, which allows you to share your theme with others without having to do a pull request (looking at you, Monkeytype).


## Competition mode
Work in progress! This is a challenging part because it requires a basic anticheat and more user trust.
